# pac-bayes-wgan

This repository includes the code associated to the paper:
### PAC-Bayesian generalization guarantees for adversarial generative models, ICML 2023
##### Sokhna Diarra Mbacke, Florence Clerc, Pascal Germain

The codes uses the implementation of [Lipschitz-continuous neural networks](https://github.com/cemanil/LNets) provided by Anil et al., 2019, as well as parts of the implementation of [probabilistic neural networks](https://github.com/mperezortiz/PBB) provided by Perez-Ortiz et al., 2021.
